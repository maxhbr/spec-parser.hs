class Build {
<b>Summary</b>
Class that describes a build instance of software/artifacts.
<b>Description</b>
A build is a representation of the process in which a piece of software
or artifact is built. It encapsulates information related to a build
process and provides an element from which relationships can be created
to describe the build's inputs, outputs, and related entities (e.g.
builders, identities, etc.).

Definitions of "BuildType", "ConfigSource", "Parameters" and
"Environment" follow those defined in [SLSA
provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2).

ExternalIdentifier of type "urlScheme" may be used to identify build
logs. Comment should be "LogReference".

    gitoid : gitoid stands for Git Object ID. A gitoid of typeblob is a unique hash
of a software artifact. Git relies on a Merkle Tree to index stored
objects. See https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects.
GitBOM is an amalgam of the terms "Git" and "SBOM". GitBOM is a
minimalistic schema to describe software dependency graphs using a
Merkle Tree, and is inspired by Git. A gitoid may refer to either the
software artifact or its GitBOM document; this ambiguity exists because
the GitBOM document is itself an artifact, and the gitoid of that
artifact is its valid locator.

abstract LicenseExpression {
<b>Summary</b>
Abstract class representing a license expression consisting of one or
more licenses (optionally including exceptions), which may be combined
according to the SPDX license expression syntax.
<b>Description</b>
A LicenseExpression is used by a licensing field for a software package,
file or snippet when its value is not NOASSERTION or NONE. It can be a
single license (either on the SPDX License List or a custom-defined
license); a single license with an "or later" operator applied; the
foregoing with an exception applied; or a set of licenses combined by
applying "AND" and "OR" operators recursively.

Base abstract class used for all fields that can take a value of either
a license expression, NOASSERTION, or NONE.
<b>Description</b>
A LicenseField is the primary value that is used by a licensing field
for a software Package, File or Snippet. It represents either a license
expression, or the values NOASSERTION or NONE. The specific meanings of
NOASSERTION or NONE for the particular licensing field are defined in
the corresponding property description.

**TBD** whether the meaning of NoAssertionLicense in the context of the
concludedLicense and declaredLicense properties should be here rather
than in those property definitions

A NoAssertionLicense is the primary value that is used by a
concludedLicense or declaredLicense field that indicates that the SPDX
data creator is making no assertion about the license information for
the corresponding software Package, File or Snippet.

The specific meaning of NoAssertionLicense in the context of a
concludedLicense or declaredLicense field is more fully set forth in the

<b>Summary</b>
Concrete class representing an absence of an assertion about the

property instead of here

A NoAssertionText is the primary value that is used by a copyrightText
field that indicates that the SPDX data creator is making no assertion
about whether any copyright information is present, or what its contents
are if it is present.

If a copyrightText has a NOASSERTION value, this indicates that one of
the following applies: \* the SPDX data creator has made no attempt to
determine this field; or \* the SPDX data creator has intentionally
provided no information (no meaning should be implied from the absence
of an assertion).

A NoneLicense is the primary value that is used by a concludedLicense or

class OrLaterOperator {
<b>Summary</b>
Portion of a LicenseExpression representing this version, or any later
version, of the indicated License.
<b>Description</b>
An OrLaterOperator indicates that this portion of the LicenseExpression
represents either (1) the specified version of the corresponding
License, or (2) any later version of that License. It is represented in
the SPDX License Expression Syntax by the `+` operator.

It is context-dependent, and unspecified by SPDX, as to what constitutes
a "later version" of any particular License. Some Licenses may not be
versioned, or may not have clearly-defined ordering for versions. The
consumer of SPDX data will need to determine for themselves what meaning
to attribute to a "later version" operator for a particular License.

class Package {
<b>Summary</b>
MISSING
<b>Description</b>
If SPDX information is being used to describe packages, then one
instance of the package information per package being described shall
exist. It provides important meta information about the package as a
whole. Packages are an abstract concept that can be used to refer to any
distribution of software, typically consisting of one or more files and
capable of containing sub-packages. Starting with SPDX 2.0, it is not
necessary to have a package wrapping a set of files.

A package refers to any unit of content that can be associated with a
distribution of software. Typically, a package is composed of one or
more files. An SPDX document may, but is not required to, provide
details about the individual files comprising a package (see File.md).

Any of the following non-limiting examples may be (but are not required
to be) represented in SPDX as a package:

-   a tarball, zip file or other archive
-   a directory or sub-directory
-   a separately distributed piece of software which another Package or
    File uses or depends upon (e.g., a Python package, a Go module, ...)
-   a container image, and/or each image layer within a container image
-   a collection of one or more sub-packages
-   a Git repository snapshot from a particular point in time

Note that some of these could be represented in SPDX as a file as well.

In an SPDX document, relationship elements can be used to indicate
relationships between packages, such as dependency relationships.

Cardinality: Optional, zero or many.
