<b>Summary</b>
Portion of a LicenseExpression representing a set of licensing
information where only any one of the elements applies.
<b>Description</b>
A DisjunctiveLicenseSet indicates that *only one* of its subsidiary
LicenseExpressions is required to apply. In other words, a
DisjunctiveLicenseSet of two or more licenses represents a licensing
situation where *only one* of the specified licenses are to be complied
with. A consumer of SPDX data would typically understand this to permit
the recipient of the licensed content to choose which of the
corresponding license they would prefer to use. It is represented in the
SPDX License Expression Syntax by the `OR` operator.
