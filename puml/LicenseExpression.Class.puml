<b>Summary</b>
Abstract class representing a license expression consisting of one or
more licenses (optionally including exceptions), which may be combined
according to the SPDX license expression syntax.
<b>Description</b>
A LicenseExpression is used by a licensing field for a software package,
file or snippet when its value is not NOASSERTION or NONE. It can be a
single license (either on the SPDX License List or a custom-defined
license); a single license with an "or later" operator applied; the
foregoing with an exception applied; or a set of licenses combined by
applying "AND" and "OR" operators recursively.
