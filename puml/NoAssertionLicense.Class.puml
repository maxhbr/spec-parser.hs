<b>Summary</b>
Concrete class representing an absence of an assertion about license
information.
<b>Description</b>
**TBD** whether the meaning of NoAssertionLicense in the context of the
concludedLicense and declaredLicense properties should be here rather
than in those property definitions

A NoAssertionLicense is the primary value that is used by a
concludedLicense or declaredLicense field that indicates that the SPDX
data creator is making no assertion about the license information for
the corresponding software Package, File or Snippet.

The specific meaning of NoAssertionLicense in the context of a
concludedLicense or declaredLicense field is more fully set forth in the
Property definitions for those fields.
