<b>Summary</b>
Concrete class representing an absence of an assertion about the
presence of copyright text.
<b>Description</b>
**TBD** whether these details should be defined in the copyrightText
property instead of here

A NoAssertionText is the primary value that is used by a copyrightText
field that indicates that the SPDX data creator is making no assertion
about whether any copyright information is present, or what its contents
are if it is present.

If a copyrightText has a NOASSERTION value, this indicates that one of
the following applies: \* the SPDX data creator has made no attempt to
determine this field; or \* the SPDX data creator has intentionally
provided no information (no meaning should be implied from the absence
of an assertion).
